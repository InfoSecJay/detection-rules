### Goal
The primary goal of this ADS is to establish a comprehensive framework for detecting and alerting on threat events such as vulnerabilities, spyware, viruses, and wildfire incidents. This will ensure timely identification and response to security threats, minimizing potential impacts on organizational assets.

### Categorization
These attempts are categorized as:
- [Initial Access / Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)

### Strategy Abstract

The stragey will function as follows:
- Monitor all THREAT type signatures generated by Palo Alto Networks security profiles.
- Alert on any signature coming from the internal network.
- Alert on any signatures coming from the public network that was alerted (allowed).
- Identify and filter out any known vulnerability scanners or security testing software. 

### Technical Context

### Blind Spots and Assumptions

This strategy relies on the following assumptions:

- Security profiles are configured according to best practicesn by the vendor.
- SSL inspection is enabled on IPv4 policies to inspect traffic.
- SIEM is successfully indexing network IPS logs.

A blind spot will occur if any of the assumptions are violated. For instance, the following would trip the alert:

- Security profiles are not adequately configured
- SSL inspection is not enabled on IPv4 policies configured with security profiles.
- A legitimate threat signature is added as an exception in the firewall policy.
- SIEM is not successfully indexing network IPS logs.

### False Positives
There are several instances where false positives will occur:
- Vulnerability scanners
- Misconfigured systems.
- Legacy applications

### Validation

Validation can occur for this ADS by performing the following execution on any Windows host:
